/** String table.
\warning
Don't cache the char* pointer, the content of this table may be relocated.

\brief
This implements a string table for **string interning**, i.e. converting
back and forth between **strings** and **int** representations which we call
`astring_ref_t`. This can be used to compress data structures containing
repeated strings.

For cache friendliness all data is stored in a single continuous buffer.
You can move this buffer around freely in memory. You are responsible for
allocating the buffer. If the buffer runs out of memory you are responsible
for resizing it before you can add more strings.

String table is POD, that can be saved to and loaded from disk without any
need for pointer patching. Just make sure to call \ref astring_table_pack
before saving so that it uses as little memory as possible.

This structure representing a string table. The data for string table is
stored directly after this header in memory and consists of a hash table
followed by a string data block.

\warning
\ref aasm_prototype_t and \ref aasm_current_t are reserved for advanced purpose
like optimization, which provides direct access to the assembler internal. The
content of these structure may be relocated after a call to these following
functions, use it at your own risk:
- \ref aasm_emit
- \ref aasm_add_constant
- \ref aasm_add_import
- \ref aasm_reserve
- \ref aasm_push

\brief
The assembler is context sensitive, which can be used to authoring multiple
prototypes with just only single instance, in nested manner. Generally, for
each \ref aasm_push or \ref aasm_open a new context will be created for
nested prototype, and that also saves the current context onto an internal
stack, which can be restored later by a corresponding \ref aasm_pop.

This struct itself is not POD, then must rely on \ref achunk_header_t as the
portable format for exchanges. That format enable assembler as a **framework**
to working with byte code between optimization passes.
